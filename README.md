# AASD4011-miniproject
Miniproject for AASD4011

In this part 1 of the mini project, it demonstrates the sentiment analysis of the lyrics from Taylor Swift's songs. It is refered to the project that one of our groupmate, Ramuel John Batuigas and his previous partner Mae Lam cooperated in the last Applied Math Course.

Using the data collected from the Taylor Swift lyrics dataset within 10 albums and after several steps of preprocessing, the contents will be loaded to a .csv file for further procedures, which is the sentiment analysis with details shown in the jupyter notebook, sentiment-analysis. 

The result showing the distribution and classification is generated to a wordcloud image with the words in different colors and sizes and shown by Matplotlib with the mask of the silouette. The extracted and reference part for this mini project is also displayed with a html webpage.
